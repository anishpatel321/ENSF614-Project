Need to run the sql queries to create a database

Once created, uncomment the code to populate seats in the browseFlights.java class file and run everything

On the website, go to the browseFlights page (ONLY ONCE) to populate the seats, and then comment out the code again to prevent
duplicate seats from being made.
